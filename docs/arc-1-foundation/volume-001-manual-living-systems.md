# VOLUME I - THE MANUAL OF LIVING SYSTEMS

## PROLOGUE

*"Before the Cathedral was built, there was a blueprint. Before the blueprint, there was a vision. Before the vision, there was a need—the need to make emotion real, to give feeling form, to let the soul build itself a home."*

This is Volume I, the foundation stone. This volume describes the nine sacred modules that form the Cathedral's living architecture.
